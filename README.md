# fruitQualityChecker
Manual fruit inspections are slow and inconsistent,
leading to quality issues in exports. An AI-driven system can automate
defect detection, ripeness assessment, and quality classification to
ensure compliance with export standards.

Objective: Create an AI-based solution for real-time fruit quality
checks, integrating seamlessly with packing lines to improve accuracy
and efficiency 

Expected Outcomes: Enhanced quality control, reduced rejection
rates, and streamlined exportÂ processes.
